# 📌 Web Pokédex Project

This project is a functional web-based Pokédex, developed as a case study to explore and apply modern web development technologies, inspired by some designs founded on Behance (like these [Pokedex - Ui Study, from Maria Julia Barbieri](https://www.behance.net/gallery/146710797/Pokedex-Ui-Study), [Pokédex | WebDesign, from Rogélio Martines](https://www.behance.net/gallery/148252385/Pokdex-WebDesign?tracking_source=search_projects|pokedex+pokemon+web&l=20) and [Pokédex, from Abdirahim Arrale](https://www.behance.net/gallery/92008929/Pokdex?tracking_source=search_projects|pokedex+pokemon+web&l=5) ). The application provides an interactive experience for browsing Pokémon data, including their abilities, types, and stats.
